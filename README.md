# animate-screen

Breathtaking animations in React, made easy.

## Overview

Creating a website like [this](https://momentsapp.es), where captivating animations seamlessly unfold as users scroll, is a challenging endeavor. Even with the powerful [GSAP](https://gsap.com) library, navigating the intricacies of the required logic can be a daunting task.

That's why Animate Screen was created, a solution designed to streamline the process. It's engineered to simplify the intricate task of defining the diverse phases of the animation and specifying the animations in each phase.

## Dependencies

This package is built upon the [GSAP](https://gsap.com) library, but you don't need an in-depth knowledge of GSAP. A modest familiarity with the properties used in defining a tween is all that's necessary.

## Installation

To install this package you have to run the following command.

```shell
npm install animate-screen
```
